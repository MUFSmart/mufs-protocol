# The MUFS Whitepaper v1.0  
*— Manchester United Faith Smart Token*

> **"A football club and its fans are one."**  
> This is not just a slogan. It's the foundation of **MUFS** — the first smart token that turns fan emotion into digital history on Solana blockchain.

---

## Introduction

In an era of meme tokens and hype-driven projects, we launched **MUFS** — not as a financial instrument, but as a cultural experiment.

This is not speculation.  
This is memory.  
This is legacy.

MUFS is the official implementation of the **MUFS Energy Extraction Protocol (MEEP)** — a mathematical model that calculates the **digital value of success** based on:
- Fan presence at the stadium,
- Match results,
- Tournament type.

It is open-source, non-commercial, and powered by belief.

## The MUFS Energy Extraction Protocol (MEEP)

### What is MEEP?

**MEEP** (**M**anchester **U**nited **F**aith **S**mart **E**nergy **E**xtraction **P**rotocol) is the core formula behind MUFS.

It transforms emotional energy from real matches into blockchain-secured tokens.

### Core Principles

1. **Fans generate energy**  
   Every supporter present at Old Trafford or abroad contributes to the team’s strength.

2. **Success is measurable**  
   We use public data to calculate:
   - Attendance,
   - Results,
   - Tournament format.

3. **Energy becomes tokens**  
   At the end of each season, new MUFS tokens are minted and distributed.

## How MEEP Works

### 1. League Tournaments  
Each match adds energy. Higher finish = more tokens.

### 2. Cup Tournaments (FA Cup, Carabao Cup)  
Where:
- 1 = Victory → full energy,
- 2 = Draw → half energy,
- 3 = Defeat → one-third energy.

For replays (historical): divide result by **1.5**.

### 3. International Competitions (UCL, UEL, UECL)  
Since 2024/25, these tournaments follow modern format:  
- Group Stage + Knockout.
- Calculations use **Formula 2** for knockout rounds.
