## What is MUFS?

**MUFS** (**M**anchester **U**nited **F**aith **S**mart Token) is the first token that measures and immortalizes the **emotional energy of fans** as digital value in the blockchain.

It is based on a mathematical model where:
- Fan presence at the stadium generates **digital energy**.
- Match results determine how much energy is **minted into tokens**.
- Every trophy, every comeback, every goal becomes part of an immutable ledger.

This is not speculation.  
This is **memory**.

## How the Technology Works

The core concept is simple:  
> *"The energy of the fans present at the stadium during the match is generated on the final result of the team on the field — this is the digital value of the success of the football club."*

This energy is calculated using proven, logical formulas for each type of tournament.

### 1. League Tournaments (Premier League, etc.)

This type of tournament is the main competition of the football season.  
In it, the team and fans always strive to take first place or rise as high as possible in the table by the end of the season.  

The concept is: *"the higher you are in the table, the better for the club and the fans"*.

#### Formula 1:
> "The number of fans in the stadium during each game of the tournament, divided by the final place in the tournament table, is an indicator of the success of the football club in the tournament".

Success = Σ (Fans Present / Final Tournament Position)

Each official match contributes. Higher finish = more energy minted.

### 2. Cup Tournaments with Elimination Matches (FA Cup, Carabao Cup)

In this type of tournament, each individual match is crucial.  
There is no room for error — defeat means elimination.

The concept: win match by match until the trophy.

#### Formula 2:
> "The number of fans in the stadium during each match of the tournament, divided by the final result of the match (1-win, 2-draw, 3-loss), reflects the progress of the team in the tournament and its success".

Success = Σ (Fans Present / Match Result)


Where:
- 1 = Victory → full energy,
- 2 = Draw → half energy,
- 3 = Defeat → one-third energy.

At the end of the club's participation in a particular tournament, all calculations for each round are summed up — this is the earned success in that tournament.

> 💡 **Note**: In tournaments like the FA Cup and the League Cup, matches were replayed in case of a draw.  
> To maintain balance, the final result of each replayed match should be divided by **1.5** (logically and optimally).

### 3. Cup Competitions with Group Stage + Play-offs (UEFA Champions League, Europa League, Conference League)

This format represents a modern international tournament where teams and fans strive to show superiority on the world stage.

The structure is two-stage:
- **Group Stage** → mini-league,
- **Knockout Stage** → elimination.

#### Formula 3:
> "The success of the football club in this two-stage tournament is calculated by the sum of the two stages: Formula 1 + Formula 2".
Success = League Formula (Group Stage) + Cup Formula (Knockout Stage)


> ⚠️ **Important**: Starting from the 2024–2025 football season, tournaments like the Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League have changed their format.  
> Calculations of historical success in these tournaments are now produced according to **Formula 2**.

### 4. End-of-Season Summary

At the end of the season, the results of all tournaments in which the team participated are summed up.  
This is the **total digital success** of the football club for the season.

Thanks to these formulas, we preserve in history —  
> 🌟 **The emotions of several generations of fans**,  
> tied directly to the successes of the team throughout their entire history!

## Why This Matters

- This proves the **symbiosis between fans and club**.
- It turns belief into something **measurable**, **verifiable**, **ownable**.
- It creates a **living archive** of emotion from 1878 to today.

> 🌟 **Even in defeat, there is energy** — because fans showed up.  
> Their belief matters.  
> And it deserves to be recorded.

## Rules for Using This Standard

If you want to create a similar project for another club (e.g., "FCB-Smart", "ACM-History"), you must follow these rules:

1. ✅ **Name it as `[Club]-MUFS` or `[Club] Smart Token`**  
   - Example: `FCB-MUFS`, `ACM-Smart`.  
   - Never call it just "Smart Token" or copy the name "MUFS".

2. ✅ **Attribute the source**  
   Add this line to your README, website, or whitepaper:  
   > _"Inspired by the MUFS Standard — https://github.com/MUFSmart/mufs-protocol"_

3. ❌ **No commercial use without permission**  
   You cannot sell NFTs, charge fees, or monetize fan data derived from this formula.  
   This is **non-commercial** under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**.

4. 🔄 **Share improvements openly**  
   If you enhance the formula, publish it publicly.  
   Others should benefit.
